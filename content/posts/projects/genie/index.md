Was going through my [github](https://github.com/gaurav-gogia/genie) profile and that's when I noticed one of my older #projects. Here's to #nostalgia :)

Do you like creating *webapplications* in *go* but hate writing all the boilerplate code with logging, database setup, and routes?

Check out genie!

It's a web application code generator that creates a skeleton webapp project for you. Complete with database connectivity, logging, basic security, and route registrations for #crud opreations.
