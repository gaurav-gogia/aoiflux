What does it mean? It means every I/O operation is a transaction. And these transactions are performed atomically. Either they succeed or they fail. There are no half/partial writes (in theory).

Do you feel **ntfs** is reliable? Or do you prefer something more proven in the #raid world such as **zfs**?

Higher reliability of filesystems means higher probability of recovering deleted files during an investigation.
